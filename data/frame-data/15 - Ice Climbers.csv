,,,,,"Note: In general, when both Climbers are together, the AI's attacks land seven frames later.
The Climbers share frame data on attacks, but if one climber hits something, the
other will delay their attack, essentially sharing in the hitlag in order to stay at a comparable
level of desync. The Hitlag Delay column illustrates that amount of freeze.",Player | AI,Player | AI,Player | AI,,Alone | Both
